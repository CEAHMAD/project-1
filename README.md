# Tic Tac Toe Game.
A basic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML/JavaScript/CSS/jQuery.




## Challenges.
1-  CSS is the most difficult part . Youâ€™ll change one thing, two things, 3 things and nothing change. Then you make one more change and all things break.

2-  Javasicript was tje favorite pare in this project , JavaScript make it easy for you to make mistakes, which speeds up your learning curve and code can be tested in the browser.


## The approach taken.

* Winning function that stored every scenarios of wins, it is limited so this wasn't too long
* Click function by using jQuery.
* Variable that keep switch of 'X' and 'O.
* Stop function to stop the game after winnig 
* Replay function to reset the game board.



## Future extensions.
create an AI player and make this Tic Tac Toe game unbeatable by using the minimax algorithm.
